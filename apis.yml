  The US African Development Foundation (USADF) is an independent federal agency
  established by Congress to support African-led development initiatives and
  promote economic growth and prosperity in Africa. USADF provides grants and
  technical assistance to local enterprises, cooperatives, and grassroots
  organizations to help them develop sustainable businesses, create jobs, and
  improve livelihoods in underserved communities. By investing in innovation,
  entrepreneurship, and small-scale projects, USADF strives to empower African
  communities to drive their own economic development and build a more inclusive
  and equitable future for the continent.
